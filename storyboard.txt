The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee has a devolved responsibility for managing monetary 
policy. The Treasury has reserve powers to give orders to the committee 
"if they are required in the public interest and by extreme economic circumstances", 
but such orders must be endorsed by Parliament within 28 days.[11] The Bank's Financial 
Policy Committee held its first meeting in June 2011 as a macroprudential regulator 
to oversee regulation of the UK's financial sector.

GOVERNMENT INFLATION TARGET

LOWER INTEREST RATE:

reduce interest rates when they wish 
to increase investment and consumption 
in the country's economy:
may lead to the creation of an economic bubble, 
in which large amounts of investments are poured 
into the real-estate market and stock market

As interest rate lowers, predicted consumption and investment levels go up (on a chart)
As interest rate goes higher, predicted levels go down

FISHER EQUATION
real interest rate ≈ nominal interest rate − inflation rate

r = (1 + i) (1 + π)
i – the nominal interest rate
r – the real interest rate
π – the inflation rate

What Is Nominal Interest Rate?
Nominal interest rate refers to the interest rate before taking inflation into account.
The interest rate set by a central bank is the nominal interest rate.
Simple Interest (also known as nominal interest)
Simple interest is interest based on the original loan or saving amount.

For example, if you deposit £1,000 into a bank account and earn 2% interest per annum, after one year you will have £1,020. The same applies if you borrow money. If you borrow £1,000 at 2% interest per annum, after a year you would owe £1,020.

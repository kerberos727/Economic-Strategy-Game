      p1: "As of 2022 the national deficit of the UK stands at around one trillion. In 1999 the deficit was zero. A deficit is zero when government spending is the same amount as government revenue, (which is mostly through taxation.)",
      p2: "A country is in deficit when government spending is more than revenue. If annual revenue was £10 and annual spending was £15 pounds, the deficit would be £5. If revenue was £15 and spending was £10, the government would be in a surplus of £5.",
      p3: "A long term deficit is when the accumulated deficit of previous years has not been matched by revenue. If last years deficit was £5 and this years deficit was zero, the long term deficit would still be £5, even though this years deficit was nothing."

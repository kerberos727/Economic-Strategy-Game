Then you can convert this into the following sectoral balances accounting relations, 
which allow us to understand the influence of fiscal policy over private sector indebtedness. Hence, equation (4) can be rearranged to get the accounting identity for the three sectoral balances â€“ private domestic, government budget and external:
(S-I)=(G-T)+(X-M)(S-I)=(G-T)+(X-M) 
or
(S-I)+(M-X)+(T-G)=0 (S-I)+(M-X)+(T-G)=0 
or

(S-I)+(T-G)=(X-M) (S-I)+(T-G)=(X-M) 


which implies that deficits at home (private and government) result in current account or trade deficits, and thus borrowing from abroad.

The sectoral balances equation says that total private savings (S) minus private investment (I) has to equal the public deficit (spending, G minus taxes, T T) plus net exports (exports (X X) minus imports (M M)), where net exports represent the net savings of non-residents.

Another way of saying this is that total private savings (S) is equal to private investment (I) plus the public deficit spending, (G) minus taxes, T T) plus net exports (exports (X X) minus imports (M M)), where net exports represent the net savings of non-residents.

All these relationships (equations) hold as a matter of accounting and not matters of opinion.

Thus, when an external deficit (X-M<0 X-M<0 ) and public surplus (G-T<0 G-T<0 ) coincide, there must be a private deficit. While private spending can persist for a time under these conditions using the net savings of the external sector, the private sector becomes increasingly indebted in the process.

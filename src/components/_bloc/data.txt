MERCOSUR
The MERCOSUR is one of the world’s fastest growing trading blocs with its four founding members generating 70% of South America’s GNP. It is also one of the world’s leading economic blocs and the fifth largest economy. It was established on 26 March 1991 with the Treaty of Assunción by Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. This bloc aims to accelerate sustained economic development based on social justice, environmental protection, and poverty reduction. Aside from its four founding countries, Venezuela and Bolivia have also joined this tariff union in 2006 and 2015, respectively. However, Venezuela’s membership was suspended since 2016 due to its failure to comply with MERCOSUR’s democratic principles. This bloc also has Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, and Surinam as associate members who can only do preferential trade; they are not allowed to have tariff benefits. As of 2019, MERCOSUR’s top external trading partners are China, the EU, the US, Chile, and Mexico.

    "At the Monetary Policy Committee we are responsible for directing the government’s monetary policy. Our task is to set the interest rate and keep inflation close to the government’s inflation target. We also deal with quantitative easing and forward guidance.",

    objective: "The interest rate (or bank rate) is the interest rate that banks and lenders pay when they borrow from the Bank of England. It influences most interest rates, including savings accounts, credit cards, loans and mortgages. Usually mortgage rates go up or down quite soon after the base rate changes. The inflation target is currently set at %2. If the inflation rate is above this number it may be wise to set the interest rate higher.",

    textIntro: "Inflation is the decline of purchasing power of a given currency over time. A quantitative estimate of the rate at which the decline in purchasing power occurs can be reflected in the increase of an average price level of a basket of selected goods and services in an economy over some period of time (eg. Consumer Price Index or CPI).",
    cpi: "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services, such as transportation, food, and medical care. It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them. Changes in the CPI are used to assess price changes associated with the cost of living. The CPI is one of the most frequently used statistics for identifying periods of inflation or deflation.",
    cpiPrice: "Prices may increase for a number of reasons. They can be roughly divided into two categories: cost-push and demand-pull. Demand-pull inflation is when consumer demand outpaces the available supply of many types of consumer goods. Inflation sets in, forcing an overall increase in the cost of living. Cost-push inflation is when supply costs rise or supply levels fall. Either will drive up prices—as long as demand remains the same. Shortages or cost increases in labor, raw materials, and capital goods create cost-push inflation. These components of supply are also part of the four factors of production.",
    cpiWeight: "The weights are based on the relative importance of the product to households –  for example, if a household spends 8% of their income on chocolate, and 25% on transport, the weights would be 8 and 25 respectively. However this is usually an estimate by economists. At moments of structural change, it is the weighting schemes that are used to construct price indices that come under pressure. Price index numbers are based on the assumption that the proportion of spending on food, clothing, housing, travel etc remain relatively constant over time. Statisticians face a dilemma as to whether to hold the share of different goods in the consumption basket constant, or whether to adjust to the new circumstances. Transport spending is down, whereas other goods and services are up. Unsurprisingly, the prices for transport services are rising less fast than for everything else. If you adjust the weights to downgrade the lower level of spending on travel, you produce a higher inflation number."
